# Day 2
This was a lot of fun, but I had a bit of tequila last night, so I ended up sleeping on this one for a while. 

I didn't want to solve this via brute force and figured it would be fun to mess with numerical values of the guesses to solve this puzzle. 

I feel a bit of pride on how I solved this one.
