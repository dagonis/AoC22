# Day 7
Today was difficult. I spent too much time thinking this was a recursion problem before doing a bit of research. I figured there had to be someway to represent these aggregate directory stacks. Turned out that `accumulate` was what I was looking for. 

Not sure if I will use it again, but it was neat to tinker with and finally get this working. 

Honestly, the test input today was insufficient. I had broken code that passed the test case.

Not going to golf the code today, leaving it a mess.
