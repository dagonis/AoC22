# Day 4
Stayed out late going to a music festival last night, so didn't get to this until the next day.

My first thought was to use sets (similar to what I did yesterday) and look for overlap that way, but figured there was a way to do it a bit more simply. Turns out, there was! With some basic comparisons, I could determine the overlap pretty quickly. 

I did a bit of time testing and not using sets was ~4x faster than using them. 

This was fun! Looking forward to day 5.

I did minify the code a bit, I originally had two separate loops, but realized it could be done in a single pass.
