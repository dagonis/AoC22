# Day 5
A fun day, I stayed up to work on this when it dropped. Got in the 5000s for the leaderboard.

This was the first puzzle this year that I was dreading what the part 2 would be, but it actually turned out to be pretty easy.

Most of my time (probably 80%) was thinking about how to take the puzzle input and put it into a usable format. After that, implementing the rules was fairly simple.
