# Day 3
Had a lot of fun with this one. I started late, so I decided to just take my time and enjoy the solving.

I knew there were a lot of brute force methods I could have used to solve this, but I tried to keep it fairly simple.

This challenge gave me an appreciation of all the tools that Python just gives you for free (ascii_letters, sets, comprehensions).
